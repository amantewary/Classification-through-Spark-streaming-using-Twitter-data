### 1. Task Description

The task of this assignment was to perform sentiment analysis on stream of tweets using Apache spark and storing the results in CSV format. We were instructed to install Apache Spark on AWS however we installed it on Microsoft Azure. We are using python 2.7 for this assignment and Spark 2.3.1.

</br>

### 2. Installation Notes

* python 3 (if not present)
* pip3 (if not present)
* pandas
* tweepy
* Apache spark


#### Build Instructions:

1. To install python3 execute this command.

        sudo apt-get install -y python3-pip
        
2. Using pip you have to intall other libraries. To install tweepy execute this command.

        pip3 install tweepy
        
3. Install pandas next by executing this command.

        sudo -H pip3 install pandas
        
4. Install Apache Spark

        http://apache.mirror.rafal.ca/spark/spark-2.3.0/spark-2.3.0-bin-hadoop2.7.tgz
        
        sudo tar zxvfspark-2.3.0-bin-hadoop2.7.tgz

### 3. Twitter Tweet Extraction

We are using **[tweepy](https://github.com/tweepy/tweepy)** to run a query and extract tweets. The tweets are fetched using Twitter Stream Listener. We are not cleaning the tweets and pushing it directly to the model. The model is trained using a training csv and then the model is fitted into the pipline.

### 4. Sentiment Analysis Algorithm

For this Assignment we have used **RandomForestClassifier** because from our analysis it gave us the maximum accuracy. We trained the model with 500 tweets and the accuracy is 57%. Despite our various attempts, we were not able to increase the accuracy of the model more than 57%. Since it is a classifcation problem, the model which was trainined had 3 labels, making it a 3 class classification problem.

### 5. Labelling training data

We already received labelled data to train our model. The data is available [here](http://help.sentiment140.com/for-students/). The data is in a CSV format with mostly all the emojis removed. The file has 6 fields and 3 labels. the polarity of the tweet (0 = negative, 2 = neutral, 4 = positive). The data went through a ...
